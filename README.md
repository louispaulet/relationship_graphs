# Relationship Graphs 🕸️

This project is an exciting exploration into the world of character relationships. Whether they are real or fictional characters, understanding the web of relationships between them can provide deep insights into their stories and behaviors. This project aims to visualize those relationships using interactive graphs. 🌐

## How It Works 🧐

1. **Generating Relationship JSON Files:** The project started with a conversation with ChatGPT, a language model developed by OpenAI. The aim was to generate relationship JSON files that map the relationships between various real or fictional characters. For example, you might have a JSON file for the relationships between the characters in the "Lord of the Rings" series.

2. **Proof of Concept Notebook:** The next step was to create a Jupyter notebook called `GPT4_Relationship_Graphs.ipynb` that uses `networkx` and `matplotlib` to visualize these relationships as graphs. This provided a proof of concept for the project.

3. **Interactive Website:** To make the graphs more interactive and accessible, a simple website was created using D3.js. This website allows users to explore the relationships in a more hands-on way.

4. **Multiple JSON Files Support:** To extend the functionality of the website, support for multiple JSON files was added. This means you can visualize multiple different relationship graphs, depending on which JSON file you choose to load.

5. **Download Graph as PNG:** A feature to download the current graph as a PNG image file was added. Users can now save their explorations and share them with others.

## Getting Started 🚀

To get started with this project, clone the repository and run the `GPT4_Relationship_Graphs.ipynb` notebook. This will generate a relationship graph using the provided JSON file.

For the interactive website, you will need to host it on a server. You can do this locally using a simple HTTP server. Once the server is running, navigate to the site in your browser and start exploring the relationship graphs!

## Future Directions 🔮

There are endless possibilities for extending this project. You could generate more complex relationship JSON files, improve the interactivity of the website, or even integrate it with a database to store and manage your relationship data. The sky's the limit!
